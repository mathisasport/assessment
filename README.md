<p>allows students to take multiple choice tests. in its simplest form, simply replaces the scantron.</p>
<p>collections: questions.</p>
<p>insert 3 questions, generate 3 sets of radio buttons.</p>
<p>make each set have a distinct name</p>
<p>student presses submit button, responses recorded.</p>
<p>v0.2 test results calculated: 
<ul>
<li>done. new collection: student_responses</li>
<li>done. each radio button line should contain _id of question, rather than number.</li>
<li>back out number? number associated with a question doesn't make sense anymore. Instead, number makes sense as part of a set of questions in a test. revisit this when doing IFUR creation of tests in the client interface.</li>
<li>done. button (I'm finished. Record and score my answers.)</li>
<li>compare response to correct answer</li>
<li>insert student_response: student_id, question_id, response, correct answer, score</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>mutliple students</p>
